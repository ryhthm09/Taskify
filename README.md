This is a todo list web application made using HTML CSS BootStrap.For backend I have used Nodejs express and the data is being saved in MongoDB Server

The new feature of the web application is if you write
https://taskify-uwi4.onrender.com/<your name>

it will generate for you a new todolist with that name and you can access it any time

The website is hosted on https://taskify-uwi4.onrender.com/
